**KOCUROS** is a fun, browser-based operating system I created out of boredom.  
It’s a hobby project where I experiment with web technologies and UI design.  

Think of it as a **mini OS you can open in your browser**, with apps, a taskbar, and even a calendar!

## 🎯 Why I made it

I got bored and wanted to **play with web technologies** while making something fun.  
It’s a **learning playground** for me to experiment with JS, HTML, and CSS.
